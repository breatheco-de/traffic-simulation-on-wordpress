This project seeks to generate artificial traffic from a Kali Linux machine to a website hosted on a Debian server using the Apache Benchmark (ab) tool. Additionally, monitoring tools will be implemented on the server to detect traffic surges and evaluate its performance.

<onlyfor saas="false" withBanner="false">

## üå± How to start a project?

Do not clone any repository! Just follow instructions below:

To carry out this project, we will need 2 virtual machines:

- One will be the Debian virtual machine where we previously built [the WordPress website](https://4geeks.com/interactive-exercise/deploying-wordpress-site-debian).
- The other will be the Kali virtual machine as the attacker. If you have not installed Kali Linux yet, please follow these instructions: [Installing Kali Linux on a virtual machine](https://github.com/breatheco-de/installing-kali-linux-on-virtual-machine).

### Requirements

* Oracle VirtualBox
* Virtual machine with Kali Linux (Attacker): To generate traffic.
* Virtual machine with Debian (Web Server): Where we have the Apache server and the WordPress site hosted.

</onlyfor>

## üìù Instructions

### Step 1: Configure the Network in VirtualBox

#### Configure the Network of the Debian Machine (Web Server)

- [ ] Open VirtualBox.
- [ ] Select your Debian virtual machine and click on "Settings".
- [ ] Go to the "Network" section and ensure that "Adapter 1" is enabled and set to "Bridged Adapter".
- [ ] En el campo "Nombre", selecciona el adaptador de red f√≠sica que deseas usar (el que tu host est√° utilizando para conectarse a la red, como Wi-Fi o Ethernet). Esto suele ser algo como "Intel(R) Ethernet Connection" o "Wi-Fi".
- [ ] Save the changes and close the settings window.


#### Configure the Network of the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker)

- [ ] Select your Kali Linux virtual machine and click on "Settings".
- [ ] Go to the "Network" section and ensure that "Adapter 1" is enabled and set to "Bridged Adapter".
- [ ] In the "Name" field, select the same physical network adapter you selected for the Debian machine.
- [ ] Save the changes and close the settings window.

### Step 2: Obtain the IP Address of the Machines to Connect Them.

With "Bridged Adapter" configured, the machines should automatically obtain an IP address from your router or network's DHCP server.

#### On the Debian Machine (Web Server)

- [ ] Start the Debian virtual machine.
- [ ] Open a terminal and execute the `$ ip addr show` command to view the assigned IP address:
  
Look for the section corresponding to your network interface (usually `eth0` o `enp0s3`) and find the line that starts with inet. There you will see the assigned IP address, something like `192.168.1.x`.

#### On the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker)

- [ ] Open a terminal and execute the `$ ip addr show` command to view the assigned IP address:

Look for the section corresponding to your network interface (usually `eth0` o `enp0s3`) and find the line that starts with inet. There you will see the assigned IP address, something like `192.168.1.x`.


### Step 3: Verify the Connection Between the Machines

#### From the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):

- [ ] Open a terminal and ping the Debian machine to verify the connection:

```bash
$ ping <IP_debian>
```

> Replace <IP_debian> with the IP address you obtained for the Debian machine.

#### From the Debian Machine (Web Server): 

- [ ] Open a terminal and ping the Kali Linux machine to verify the connection:

```bash
$ ping <IP_kali>
```
> Replace <IP_kali> with the IP address you obtained for the Kali machine.

### Step 4: Simulate Traffic on the Website

#### On the Kali Linux Machine (Attacker):
We will use Apache Benchmark (AB) as a tool to generate traffic on the website.

#### Installation and Usage of Apache Benchmark
Apache Benchmark (AB) is a tool that allows you to generate test traffic to a web server. Follow these steps to install and use ab from Kali Linux:
1. Installation of Apache Benchmark

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install apache2-utils
```

2. Generate Traffic to the Website

```bash
$ ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://<IP_debian>/
```
***The command  `ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://<IP_debian>/` hwill make Apache Bench send 1000 HTTP requests to the web server at http://<IP_debian>/, with 10 requests being made concurrently, simulating 10 concurrent users accessing the server..***

> NOTE: Replace <IP_debian> with the IP address of the Debian server.


### Step 5: Monitoring Server Performance
On the Debian server, we are going to install monitoring tools like htop to observe the performance during the tests.

#### Installing htop
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install htop
```

#### Real-Time Monitoring with htop

`htop` is an interactive process monitoring tool that provides a detailed view of the system resource usage. 

- [ ] Run the following command in the terminal to monitor CPU, memory, and other system resources in real-time while running tests with Apache Benchmark.

```bash
$ htop
```
You will see something like this:
![monitoreo con htop](https://github.com/breatheco-de/traffic-simulation-on-wordpress/blob/main/assets/monitor-htop.png?raw=true)


* **CPU Usage**: Shows real-time CPU usage, usually divided into bars representing each CPU core.
* **Memory Usage**: Displays RAM and swap memory usage.
* **Tasks**: Lists active processes with details such as PID, user, CPU and memory usage, runtime, and the command that started the process.
* **Load Average**: Shows the system load average over the last 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
* **Uptime**: Indicates how long the system has been running since the last reboot.

## Project Delivery

In the cloned repository, you must submit 2 reports.

- [ ] The first report should be named `report_ab.txt`. Generate this report when performing the attack on your Kali virtual machine with the following command:

```bash
$ ab -n 5000 -c 200 http://<IP_debian>/ > report_ab.txt
```

- [ ] The second report should be created with the name `report_htop.txt` and include observations on the server performance on your Debian machine while using htop.

> ***Copy these lines into the `report_htop.txt` file and fill in the corresponding information.***

```yml
  observations:
  evaluation_if_server_could_handle_load:
    - performance_metrics:
        - stable_memory: # Here you can note how many requests per second maintained stable memory usage
        - cpu_load_average: # Here you can note what average CPU load percentage was maintained

  specification_of_excessive_resource_usage:
    - cpu_peak_usage:
        - observed: true  # Indicate if a CPU usage peak of 90% was observed during the first few minutes of maximum load (the value would be true or false)
        - peak_percentage: 90
        - request_count_at_peak:
            - value:  # Here you can note the specific number of requests at which the peak occurred
```
